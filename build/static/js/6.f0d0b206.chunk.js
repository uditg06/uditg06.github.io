Most of these people are under represented and do not have access to traditional banking systems. \n\nBefore Airtel, I have worked at Sabre and have helped them to redefine the future of Airline Booking using NDC channel. New Distribution Channel(NDC), can work along side tranditional GDS and provide a dynamic and more user centric approach for airline booking. NDC focuses on travellers and provide them with real-time content personalized for a traveller.\nIn past, I have also worked as a technical team leader, where I led the backend technical teams and helped organizations to move to microservices based architecture.\n\nI am really passionate about Digital Products, and I strongly believe that technology can have a huge postive impact on the lives of people. I am data driven and have empathy for the users using my prodcuts.\n\n If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Work Experiences\n\n- **Airtel Africa**, Technical Product Manager, November 2021 - Present\n- **Sabre**, Technical Prodcut Manager, Decemebr 2019 - November 2021\n- **Cognizant**, Associate, January 2014 - December 2019\n\n# I like\n\n- Science\n- Adeventures \n- Good design\n- Running\n- Winter\n- Books\n- Podcasts\n- [Good design](/)\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(i.b,Object(r.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Udit Garg",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
