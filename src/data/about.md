# Intro

I am currently a Technical Product Manager at Airtel Africa, working on digital inclusion and connecting millions of people with digital banking. Most of the people and communities we serve do not have access to traditional banking systems; thus, providing them with digital banking services helps us positively impact their lives.

Before Airtel, I worked at Sabre and helped them redefine the future of Airline Booking using the NDC channel. New Distribution Channel(NDC) can work alongside traditional GDS and provide a dynamic and user-centric airline booking approach. NDC is XML-based, focuses on travelers, and offers real-time and personalized content. In the past, I have also worked as a technical team leader, where I led technical teams and helped organizations to move to modern architectures and create more reliable, manageable, and faster systems.

I am passionate about Digital Products, and I firmly believe that technology can substantially positively impact people's lives. I am data-driven and have empathy for the users.

If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
